                        When John Bennett was a little boy, he made a wish that
                        Ted, his beloved teddy bear, would come alive. Thirty
                        years later, foul-mouthed Ted is still John's constant
                        companion much to the chagrin of Lori, John's
                        girlfriend. Though Lori's displeasure is exacerbated by
                        the pair's constant consumption of beer and weed, she's
                        not the one who's most disappointed with John; it may
                        take the intervention of John's boyhood toy to help him
                        grow up at last.

                        Middle Ages as told through the story of King Arthur and

                        quest for the Holy Grail, they face a wide array of
